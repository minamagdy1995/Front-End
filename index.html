                                        The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some

                                        may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.

                                        symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                                        develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                                        disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                                        COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                                        those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                                        diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and
                                        difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                        To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new

                                        could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which
                                        spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or
                                        sneezes,
                                        or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean
                                        your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
                                        water.
                                        Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

                                        However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.
                                        This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become
                                        sick and develop a fever.
